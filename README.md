# hello-world
my first demo repository
I have minimal coding experience in Java and C++ but have long programmed in Visual Basic. I am motiviated to aggregate data, create useful analytics models, while streamlining processes and increasing efficiency for organization. I know advanced coding is the best way to achieve all of this, but doing it efficiently and securely are my goals. I want a test environment for some of my ideas.
